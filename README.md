## Notes
Keep in mind this is just a quick mockup application, so don't expect to buy any product there ðŸ˜œ

I made this only for iOS right now, but getting it working on Android should be really simple

## How to run it?
Install `react-native` in your system if you didn't yet:

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Install node packages:

```
npm install
```

Link your code:

```
react-native link
```

Run the app in the Simulator:

```
react-native run-ios
```
